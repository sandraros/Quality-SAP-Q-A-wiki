Welcome to SAP Questions and Answers !

This is a collection of well-asked questions and argumented answers taken from the Web, especially [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which follow the Editorial line shown below. 

Search the wiki pages by:
* either clicking the "Pages" hyperlink on the right, there is a search field for page titles
* or browsing the wiki via the [[Table of contents.md]] (there's a link at the right of all pages)

You're welcome to enrich this wiki. Please follow the rules below.

# Participate, propose changes

There are three ways to change the contents:
* Either change directly the page https://github.com/sandraros/
* Or subscribe and log into github, fork the repository https://github.com/sandraros/Quality-SAP-Q-A.wiki.git, create a branch, change the pages you want and create a pull request.
* Or become an Editor of the GitHub master project, if you're among the best contributors.

Non-editor posts are appended to a queue and have to be accepted before the edit is made visible.

# Editorial line

* Contents of wiki pages
  * No articles in the wiki pages, only external links and minimal text
    * The preferred approach is to link articles from StackExchange network (for instance [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tour)) because they can be edited, need to be 
    * Describe what distinguishes two links in the same page
  * Add link to the external article
    * Edit a more general wiki page to add the link to the external page. If there is no more general wiki page, eventually create it or update the [[Table of contents.md]] if it's a very high-level topic.
  * New wiki page
    * Edit other pages so that the new wiki page can be accessed from the [[Table of contents.md]], directly or indirectly.
    * Its title should be precise so that the visitors search the fewest pages possible via the "Pages" link
* What external page can you link
  * Clear and concise
    * Follow rules of StackExchange network
  * No topic mix
    * For instance the page should not explain how to convert a text to PDF and how to download a PDF to a file, 
  * Minimal text
    * Repeated code or text should be in one dedicated page, and other pages should refer to it
    * Code snippets should be minimal, like they shouldn't contain exception handling
    * No repetition: include references to the existing sources, i.e. don't repeat existing blog posts, just propose a quick abstract if needed and refer to the source
  * Generalized
    * The text and code as far as possible, i.e. a basic ABAP code about reading a file should contain elements contained in all ABAP-based softwares (common to ERP, CRM, SRM, etc.)
  * Scoped
    * Is it SAP ERP or CRM, what version(s), etc.

# History
I have created this wiki after Jelena initiated a [discussion](https://answers.sap.com/articles/12935170/repetitive-blog-posts.html) about the quality of SAP Community blog posts (many blog posts with duplicate content) and after the comment from Frederic about creating a hierarchy/structure of articles to quickly find the most valuable blog posts. I propose that this wiki also applies to questions and answers.
